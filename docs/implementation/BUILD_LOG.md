# Implementation log

## 2026-11-03 — Repository bootstrap

**Scope**
- Added the initial Next.js/React/TypeScript application skeleton.
- Added environment template and repository ignore rules.
- Added Prisma singleton infrastructure.
- Added the first identity/access persistence draft: user, role, permission, scoped assignment, session, OAuth account, reset/verification tokens, consent, login attempts, and audit log.
- Added architecture notes and verification requirements.

**Status**
- Files committed to GitHub: yes.
- Dependencies installed: not run (no local shell/runtime attached to this repository).
- Prisma validate/generate: not run.
- PostgreSQL migration: not created or applied.
- Typecheck/lint/tests/build: not run.
- Authentication workflows: not implemented.
- Identity system: foundation draft only; not complete.

**Next**
1. Verify package versions and framework compatibility with Node.js 22.
2. Install dependencies and run Prisma validate/generate.
3. Add a deterministic seed for baseline system roles and permissions.
4. Implement environment validation, structured errors, and server-side authorization policy tests.
5. Implement registration/login/session lifecycle as the first end-to-end vertical slice.

## 2026-11-03 — Blueprint and CI baseline

**Added**
- Imported the complete 49-system blueprint into `docs/architecture/COMPLETE_PLATFORM_SYSTEMS_BLUEPRINT.md` as the target functional specification for Mtjr2.
- Added Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS configuration.
- Added Vitest configuration and the first email-normalization unit test.
- Added a GitHub Actions CI workflow using Node.js 22 and PostgreSQL 16. It runs Prisma validation/generation, typecheck, lint, unit tests, and production build.
- Added the initial test strategy document.

**Verification**
- Re-fetched the key files from GitHub and confirmed that they exist on `main`.
- GitHub Actions run was created: [CI run](https://github.com/waelkamira/mtjr2/actions/runs/41572745940).
- At the time of this log update, the workflow was still queued. No passing result is claimed.
- No local dependency installation, Prisma validation, client generation, migration, typecheck, lint, or test execution has been performed in this session.

**Next gate**
- Wait for and inspect the CI result; fix any dependency/configuration/schema issues it reports.
- Only after a successful clean PostgreSQL migration rehearsal should the initial identity schema be treated as a validated baseline.


## 2026-11-03 — CI bootstrap failure and correction

**Observed failure**
- The first CI run failed in `actions/setup-node@v4` before dependency installation.
- The workflow requested npm caching, but the repository did not yet contain a lockfile. Consequently all validation and test steps were skipped; this was an infrastructure failure, not a passing or failing application test.

**Correction**
- Removed the npm cache option until a committed lockfile is available.
- The next push should trigger a fresh CI run.

**Verification**
- Workflow file update committed: `07e2c6e989bb6cb9daa2cc8be482e84236117929`.
- The rerun has not yet been observed. Prisma validation, generation, typecheck, lint, tests, and build remain unverified.


## 2026-11-03 — Identity schema review and ECC-informed workflow

**Schema review**
- Found that nullable `scopeType` and `scopeId` fields in the composite unique key for `UserRoleAssignment` would allow duplicate global/scoped assignments when PostgreSQL treats `NULL` values as distinct.
- Changed both columns to non-null strings with the reserved `GLOBAL` default for unscoped grants. Scoped grants must supply a concrete pair; service-level validation is still required.
- Updated the foundation decision record with this invariant. No migration has been generated, so this is still a pre-migration schema correction.

**Engineering method**
- Added `docs/quality/ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW.md` describing the research → plan → test → implement → review → verify → record loop, informed by ECC.
- This does not claim that ECC's plugin, agents, or skills are installed in the repository.

**CI**
- Removed npm caching from setup-node because no lockfile exists yet.
- Corrected workflow is triggering new runs; the final result is pending at this log entry.
- No Prisma/typecheck/lint/test/build pass is claimed until a completed run is inspected.


## 2026-11-03 — First authorization policy slice

**Implemented**
- Added a pure server-side permission evaluation policy in `src/server/identity/authorization.ts`.
- Global grants apply to all scopes; scoped grants apply only to an exact type/identifier match.
- Expired grants, permission mismatches, and scoped grants without a requested scope are denied.
- Added six unit tests covering global allow, exact-scope allow, cross-store denial, expiry, missing scope, and permission mismatch.

**Limit**
- This is only the policy evaluator. Trusted grant loading from the database, authentication/session resolution, API enforcement, and end-to-end tests are still not implemented.

**Verification**
- Both files were re-fetched from GitHub after commit `852c837c70aa648327a170758c4945af08901afc`.
- The latest GitHub Actions run is still executing dependency installation. No test result is claimed yet.


## 2026-11-03 — Environment validation and database-backed permission loading

**Implemented**
- Added Zod-based environment parsing for PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL`, public application URL, `AUTH_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters), and supported `NODE_ENV` values.
- Prisma singleton now validates configuration before creating a client and receives the validated database URL explicitly.
- Added configuration tests for valid values, invalid database protocol, short auth secret, and invalid app URL.
- Added a server-side permission repository that loads active user role assignments and their permissions from PostgreSQL, then evaluates them with the pure scope-aware policy.
- The repository rejects blank user IDs and documents that the ID must originate from a verified server session, never client input.

**Security boundary / remaining work**
- Authentication and trusted session resolution do not exist yet. The repository must not be exposed through a route until a verified session resolver is implemented.
- Permission assignment write paths, scope-pair validation, audit events, database migration, and integration tests remain outstanding.
- Environment validation is exercised by unit tests; no real production secrets are stored in the repository.

**Verification**
- CI run `41573058187` for commit `852c837c70aa648327a170758c4945af08901afc` completed successfully: Prisma validate/generate, TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest, and production build all passed.
- This successful run includes the pure authorization policy and its six tests, but predates the database permission repository and environment validation changes.
- CI runs for the latest commits have been triggered; their final results are pending. No pass is claimed for the newest files yet.
